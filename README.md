# Tomb1Main

This is a dynamic library for the classic Tomb Raider I game (TombATI version).
The purpose of the library is to reimplement all the routines performed by the
game and enhance the gameplay with new options.

This project is inspired by Arsunt's
[TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/) project.

## Installing

Get a copy of the latest release from
[here](https://github.com/rr-/Tomb1Main/releases) and unpack the contents to your
game directory. Make sure you overwrite existing files. Currently Tomb1Main
requires you to have the [TombATI patch](http://www.glidos.net/tombati.html)
installed to work.

## Configuring

To configure Tomb1Main, edit the `Tomb1Main.json` file in your text editor such
as Notepad. All the configuration is explained in that file.
