# TR1Main

This is a dynamic library for the classic Tomb Raider I game (TombATI version). The purpose of the library is to reimplement all the routines performed by the game and enhance the gameplay with new options.

This project is inspired by Arsunt's [TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/) project.

## Getting Started

You may download patched tombati.exe, TR1Main.dll from [releases](https://github.com/rr-/TR1Main/releases), put them in your game folder and just launch. Also you may build TR1Main.dll yourself and use it with patched tombati.exe from here.
